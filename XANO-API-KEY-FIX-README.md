# Xano API Key Handling Fix

## Problem
The application was crashing when deployed because the `XANO_API_KEY` environment variable was not set. The server was trying to use this undefined variable to authenticate with the Xano API, which caused unhandled exceptions.

## Solution
I've implemented graceful error handling for cases when the `XANO_API_KEY` environment variable is not set:

1. **API Media Endpoint (`/api/media`)**: Now checks if `XANO_API_KEY` is set before making requests to the Xano API. If not set, it returns an empty array instead of crashing.

2. **Upload Endpoint (`/api/upload`)**: Now checks if `XANO_API_KEY` is set before saving files to Xano. If not set, it returns a success response with a warning message and mock data.

3. **Thumbnail Migration Endpoint (`/api/migrate-thumbnails`)**: Now checks if `XANO_API_KEY` is set before attempting migration. If not set, it returns an error response.

4. **BackendXanoService**: Added checks for `XANO_API_KEY` in the `getAllRecords` and `updateRecord` methods.

## Environment Variables

The application requires the following environment variables for full functionality:

- `XANO_API_KEY`: API key for Xano backend service
- `VITE_API_URL`: API endpoint URL (for frontend)
- `PORT`: Port number (for server deployment)

## Setting Environment Variables

### For Netlify Deployment
Set these in your Netlify site settings under "Environment variables":
- `VITE_API_URL`: Your API endpoint URL
- `VITE_XANO_API_KEY`: Your Xano API key

### For Local Development
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```
XANO_API_KEY=your_xano_api_key_here
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api/media
```

### For Other Deployments
Consult your deployment platform's documentation for setting environment variables.

## Testing
After setting these environment variables, the application should:
1. No longer crash when Xano API key is missing
2. Successfully connect to Xano when the API key is provided
3. Return proper data from the `/api/media` endpoint

## Verification
You can verify the API is working by visiting your deployed API endpoint:
`[YOUR_API_URL]/api/media`

This should return a JSON array of media files from your Xano database instead of an empty array.
