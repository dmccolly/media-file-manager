# Xano API Key Handling Fix

## Problem
The application was crashing when deployed to Heroku because the `XANO_API_KEY` environment variable was not set. The server was trying to use this undefined variable to authenticate with the Xano API, which caused unhandled exceptions.

## Solution
I've implemented graceful error handling for cases when the `XANO_API_KEY` environment variable is not set:

1. **API Media Endpoint (`/api/media`)**: Now checks if `XANO_API_KEY` is set before making requests to the Xano API. If not set, it returns an empty array instead of crashing.

2. **Upload Endpoint (`/api/upload`)**: Now checks if `XANO_API_KEY` is set before saving files to Xano. If not set, it returns a success response with a warning message and mock data.

3. **Thumbnail Migration Endpoint (`/api/migrate-thumbnails`)**: Now checks if `XANO_API_KEY` is set before attempting migration. If not set, it returns an error response.

4. **BackendXanoService**: Added checks for `XANO_API_KEY` in the `getAllRecords` and `updateRecord` methods.

## Testing
After deploying these changes, the application should no longer crash even if the `XANO_API_KEY` environment variable is not set. However, to fully utilize the Xano integration features, you should:

1. Set the `XANO_API_KEY` environment variable in your Heroku app settings
2. Set the `PORT` environment variable if not already set (Heroku usually provides this automatically)

## How to Set Environment Variables in Heroku
1. Go to your Heroku Dashboard
2. Select your app
3. Go to Settings tab
4. Click "Reveal Config Vars"
5. Add the following variables:
   - Key: `XANO_API_KEY`, Value: [Your Xano API key]
   - Key: `PORT`, Value: [Port number, typically provided by Heroku]

## Verification
After setting the environment variables, you can verify the API is working by visiting:
`https://media-file-manager-43851dcc8421.herokuapp.com/api/media`

This should return a JSON array of media files from your Xano database instead of an empty array.
