# Implement Folder Persistence to Xano Database

## Overview
Add database persistence for folders so they survive page refreshes and are stored permanently in Xano.

## Current Situation Analysis
- [x] Analyzed existing code
- [x] Found folder-create.mts already tries to save to Xano
- [x] Found folder-list.mts already tries to load from Xano  
- [x] Found folder-delete.mts was just fixed (client-side only)
- [x] Identified issue: Xano folders table likely doesn't exist

## Phase 1: Xano Database Setup
- [ ] Check if folders table exists in Xano
- [ ] If not, create folders table with schema:
  ```
  Table: folder
  Fields:
  - id (integer, primary key, auto-increment)
  - name (text)
  - path (text, unique)
  - parent_path (text)
  - created_at (timestamp, default: now())
  ```
- [ ] Create Xano API endpoints:
  - GET /folder - List all folders
  - POST /folder - Create folder
  - DELETE /folder/{id} - Delete folder
- [ ] Test endpoints with Postman/curl

## Phase 2: Backend Updates
- [x] folder-create.mts - Already implemented (uses Xano table)
- [x] folder-list.mts - Already implemented (uses Xano table)
- [x] folder-delete.mts - Updated to delete from Xano database
- [ ] Test all endpoints

## Phase 3: Frontend Updates (if needed)
- [ ] Verify FolderService works with database responses
- [ ] Test folder operations end-to-end
- [ ] Add better error messages if needed

## Phase 4: Testing & Deployment
- [ ] Test folder creation with database
- [ ] Test folder deletion with database
- [ ] Test folder persistence (refresh page)
- [ ] Create PR and deploy

## Key Finding
The backend code is ALREADY written to use Xano database! The issue is:
1. Xano folders table probably doesn't exist
2. folder-delete.mts was just changed to client-side only (needs to be reverted)

## Next Steps
1. **YOU need to create the Xano table** (I can't access Xano directly)
2. Once table exists, update folder-delete.mts to use database
3. Test everything

## Current Status
Waiting for Xano table creation
