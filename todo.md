# Media File Manager - Folder Management Implementation

## ✅ Completed
- [x] Fixed folder_path filtering to include '/' as Uncategorized
- [x] Removed duplicate search fields
- [x] Deployed fixes to production

## 🚧 In Progress: Complete Folder Management System

### Architecture Overview
The old system only stored folders in React state (not persistent). We need:
1. **Xano Database**: Store folder metadata (name, path, created_at, parent_id)
2. **Cloudinary Integration**: Create actual folders for file organization
3. **Webflow Sync**: Update Webflow collections with folder structure
4. **UI Components**: Folder tree, create/rename/delete modals

### Implementation Steps

#### Phase 1: Backend Infrastructure
- [ ] Create Xano `folders` table schema
- [ ] Create Netlify function: `folder-create.mts`
- [ ] Create Netlify function: `folder-list.mts`
- [ ] Create Netlify function: `folder-update.mts`
- [ ] Create Netlify function: `folder-delete.mts`
- [ ] Update `upload.mts` to use folder paths

#### Phase 2: Frontend Services
- [ ] Create `FolderService.ts` for folder operations
- [ ] Update `CloudinaryService.ts` to support folder uploads
- [ ] Update `WebflowService.ts` to sync folder structure

#### Phase 3: UI Components
- [ ] Add "New Folder" button in header
- [ ] Create folder creation modal
- [ ] Add folder tree view (collapsible)
- [ ] Add folder context menu (rename, delete)
- [ ] Update file upload to select target folder
- [ ] Add drag-and-drop file moving between folders

#### Phase 4: Integration & Testing
- [ ] Test folder creation → Xano → Cloudinary → Webflow
- [ ] Test file upload to specific folders
- [ ] Test folder deletion (move files to parent)
- [ ] Test folder renaming (update all file paths)
