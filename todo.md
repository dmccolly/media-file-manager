# Media File Manager - Deployment Fix

## ✅ DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE!

### Successfully Deployed To Original Site
- [x] Deployed to https://eclectic-caramel-34e317.netlify.app
- [x] All 11 Netlify functions deployed and working
- [x] Environment variables already configured on this site
- [x] Health check passed: `{"ok":true,"env":true}`

### Verification
- [x] Functions accessible at `/api/*` endpoints
- [x] Static site loads correctly
- [ ] **FINAL TEST NEEDED**: Try uploading a file to verify full workflow

### What Was Fixed
1. Used correct Netlify auth token with site access
2. Deployed to original site (eclectic-caramel-34e317) instead of new site
3. Included both static files AND functions in deployment
4. All environment variables already present on original site

### Next Steps
**Please test the upload functionality:**
1. Go to https://eclectic-caramel-34e317.netlify.app
2. Try uploading a file
3. Verify the Cloudinary → Xano → Webflow pipeline works

If upload works, the project is complete! ✅
