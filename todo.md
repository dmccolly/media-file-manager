# Media File Manager - Folder Management Implementation

## ✅ Phase 1 Complete: Backend Infrastructure
- [x] Created Netlify function: `folder-create.mts`
- [x] Created Netlify function: `folder-list.mts`
- [x] Created Netlify function: `folder-delete.mts`
- [x] Created `FolderService.ts` for folder operations
- [x] Added folder state management to App.tsx
- [x] Integrated FolderService with loadFolders()

## 🚧 Phase 2: UI Components (In Progress)

### What's Working
- Backend API endpoints ready for folder CRUD
- FolderService can create, list, and delete folders
- App.tsx loads folders on mount
- State management in place

### What's Needed
1. **New Folder Button** - Add UI trigger for folder creation
2. **Folder Creation Modal** - Dialog with input for folder name
3. **Folder Dropdown** - Update folder selector to show created folders
4. **Upload Integration** - Files uploaded to selected folder

### Critical Issue: Xano Database Schema
⚠️ **The `folders` table doesn't exist in Xano yet!**

You need to create a Xano table called `folders` with these fields:
- `id` (int, auto-increment, primary key)
- `name` (text)
- `path` (text, unique)
- `parent_path` (text)
- `created_at` (int, timestamp)

### Next Steps
1. **Create Xano `folders` table** (manual step in Xano dashboard)
2. **Add New Folder button UI** (needs manual code insertion)
3. **Test folder creation end-to-end**
4. **Update file upload to use folders**
