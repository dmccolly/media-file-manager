# Deployment Guide - Cloudinary Folder Management

## Quick Start

This guide walks you through deploying the Cloudinary folder management feature to your production environment.

## Prerequisites

- [x] Code changes committed to `feature/cloudinary-folders` branch
- [ ] Cloudinary API credentials ready
- [ ] Access to Netlify dashboard
- [ ] Access to GitHub repository

## Step 1: Configure Environment Variables

### Get Cloudinary Credentials

1. Go to [Cloudinary Console](https://console.cloudinary.com/)
2. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **API Keys**
3. Copy the following values:
   - **Cloud Name**: `dzrw8nopf` (already configured)
   - **API Key**: Copy from dashboard
   - **API Secret**: Copy from dashboard (click "Reveal")

### Add to Netlify

1. Go to [Netlify Dashboard](https://app.netlify.com/)
2. Select your site: **media-file-manager**
3. Go to **Site settings** ‚Üí **Environment variables**
4. Click **Add a variable** and add these three:

| Variable Name | Value | Notes |
|--------------|-------|-------|
| `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` | `dzrw8nopf` | Your cloud name |
| `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` | `[your-api-key]` | From Cloudinary dashboard |
| `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` | `[your-api-secret]` | From Cloudinary dashboard |

5. Click **Save**

**Important:** Environment variables are only loaded during build/deploy. You'll need to redeploy after adding them.

## Step 2: Test Locally (Optional)

If you want to test before deploying:

```bash
# Set environment variables in your terminal
export CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dzrw8nopf
export CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
export CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here

# Run the test script
node test-cloudinary-folders.js
```

Expected output:
```
üß™ Testing Cloudinary Folder Operations

Configuration:
  Cloud Name: dzrw8nopf
  API Key: ‚úÖ SET
  API Secret: ‚úÖ SET

Test 1: Creating root folder...
  ‚úÖ Success: test-folder-1729654321000

...

üéâ All tests passed!
```

## Step 3: Deploy to Staging

### Push Feature Branch

```bash
git push origin feature/cloudinary-folders
```

### Deploy Branch Preview

Netlify automatically creates a deploy preview for branches:

1. Go to **Deploys** tab in Netlify
2. Find the deploy for `feature/cloudinary-folders`
3. Click on the deploy URL (e.g., `feature-cloudinary-folders--your-site.netlify.app`)

### Test in Staging

1. **Test Folder Creation:**
   - Open the media manager
   - Click "Create Folder"
   - Enter name: `test-blog-posts`
   - Click "Create Folder"
   - Verify it appears in the folder list

2. **Verify in Cloudinary:**
   - Go to Cloudinary Media Library
   - You should see `test-blog-posts` folder

3. **Test File Upload:**
   - Upload an image
   - Select folder: `test-blog-posts`
   - Complete upload
   - Verify image URL contains `/test-blog-posts/` in path

4. **Test Folder Deletion (Empty):**
   - Try to delete `test-blog-posts` (should work if empty)
   - Verify it's removed from Cloudinary

5. **Test Folder Deletion (Non-Empty):**
   - Create folder: `test-with-files`
   - Upload an image to it
   - Try to delete folder
   - Should see error: "Folder contains X file(s)..."

## Step 4: Merge to Production

### Option A: Direct Merge (Recommended)

```bash
# Switch to production branch
git checkout voxpro_update  # or your production branch name

# Merge feature branch
git merge feature/cloudinary-folders

# Push to production
git push origin voxpro_update
```

### Option B: Pull Request (If using GitHub workflow)

1. Go to GitHub repository
2. Click **Pull requests** ‚Üí **New pull request**
3. Base: `voxpro_update`, Compare: `feature/cloudinary-folders`
4. Click **Create pull request**
5. Add description and reviewers
6. After approval, click **Merge pull request**

### Netlify Auto-Deploy

Netlify will automatically deploy when you push to your production branch:

1. Go to **Deploys** tab in Netlify
2. Wait for build to complete (usually 2-3 minutes)
3. Status should show **Published**

## Step 5: Verify Production Deployment

### Check Build Logs

1. Click on the latest deploy in Netlify
2. Check **Deploy log** for any errors
3. Look for successful build message:
   ```
   ‚úì built in X.XXs
   ```

### Test Production

Repeat all tests from Step 3 on your production URL:

- [ ] Folder creation works
- [ ] Folder appears in Cloudinary
- [ ] File upload to folder works
- [ ] Folder deletion works (empty folders)
- [ ] Error message shows for non-empty folders
- [ ] UI updates correctly after operations

### Check Function Logs

1. Go to **Functions** tab in Netlify
2. Click on `folder-create`, `folder-delete`, or `folder-list`
3. Check **Function log** for any errors
4. Look for success messages:
   ```
   üìÅ Creating Cloudinary folder: blog-posts
   ‚úÖ Cloudinary folder created
   ```

## Step 6: Monitor and Troubleshoot

### Common Issues

#### Issue: "Cloudinary credentials not configured"

**Solution:**
1. Verify environment variables are set in Netlify
2. Redeploy the site (environment variables only load on deploy)
3. Check variable names match exactly:
   - `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`
   - `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`
   - `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`

#### Issue: "Cannot delete non-empty folder"

**Expected behavior:** This is correct! Cloudinary doesn't allow deleting folders with files.

**Solution:**
1. Move or delete all files in the folder first
2. Then delete the folder

#### Issue: Folder not appearing in UI

**Solution:**
1. Refresh the page
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify API endpoint is accessible: `/api/folder-list`
4. Check Netlify function logs

#### Issue: 404 on API endpoints

**Solution:**
1. Check `netlify.toml` redirects are correct
2. Verify functions are in `netlify/functions/` directory
3. Check function file extensions are `.mts` or `.js`
4. Redeploy the site

### Monitoring

Set up monitoring for:

1. **Function Errors:**
   - Netlify ‚Üí Functions ‚Üí Check error count
   - Set up alerts for high error rates

2. **Cloudinary Usage:**
   - Cloudinary Dashboard ‚Üí Usage
   - Monitor API calls and storage

3. **User Feedback:**
   - Watch for user reports of folder issues
   - Check browser console errors

## Rollback Plan

If something goes wrong:

### Quick Rollback

1. Go to Netlify ‚Üí **Deploys**
2. Find the last working deploy
3. Click **‚ãØ** ‚Üí **Publish deploy**
4. Confirm rollback

### Code Rollback

```bash
# Revert the merge commit
git revert HEAD

# Or reset to previous commit
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Push to production
git push origin voxpro_update --force
```
