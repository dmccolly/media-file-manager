# Document Preview Functionality Fixes

## Issues Identified
2. Document preview functionality was not working properly for any file type
3. The original preview implementation only supported basic file types with limited fallback options

## Changes Made

- **Issue:** The file was missing the proper `run` section and had formatting issues
- **Fix:** Updated the configuration to properly specify how to run the application:
  ```yaml
  web:
    build:
      docker:
        web: Dockerfile
    run:
      web: node server.js
  ```

### 2. Created PreviewService for Better Document Handling
- **File:** `src/services/PreviewService.ts`
- **Purpose:** Centralized service for handling all file preview types with proper fallbacks
- **Features:**
  - Google Docs Viewer integration for PDF and Office documents
  - Fallback mechanisms for when previews fail
  - Support for various file types:
    - Images: Direct display with proper sizing
    - Videos: HTML5 video player
    - Audio: HTML5 audio player
    - PDFs: Google Docs Viewer with direct embed fallback
    - Office Documents (Word, Excel, PowerPoint): Google Docs Viewer
    - Text Files: Basic placeholder with download option
    - Other Files: Generic placeholder with download option

### 3. Updated App Component to Use PreviewService
- **File:** `App.tsx`
- **Change:** Replaced the inline preview rendering logic with a call to the new PreviewService
- **Before:** Complex inline conditional logic for each file type
- **After:** Simple delegation to PreviewService: `return PreviewService.renderPreview(file);`

## How the PreviewService Works

### PDF Files
- Uses Google Docs Viewer for preview: `https://docs.google.com/gview?url=...&embedded=true`
- If Google Docs Viewer fails, falls back to direct PDF embedding

### Office Documents (Word, Excel, PowerPoint)
- Uses Google Docs Viewer for preview which supports these formats
- Provides a consistent viewing experience across different document types

### Other File Types
- Maintains existing functionality for images, videos, and audio
- Provides appropriate fallbacks for unsupported file types with download links
