# ðŸš€ Create Netlify Site from Scratch

## Since You Have No Existing Sites...

### Option 1: GitHub Integration (Recommended)
1. **Go to** [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. **Sign up** with your GitHub account
3. **Click** "Add new site" â†’ "Import from Git"
4. **Connect GitHub** and select `dmccolly/media-file-manager`
5. **Netlify auto-detects:**
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
6. **Click** "Deploy site"

### Option 2: Manual Site Creation
1. **Go to** [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. **Sign up** with GitHub
3. **Click** "Add new site" â†’ "Deploy manually"
4. **Drag & drop** the `dist` folder onto the page
5. **Get instant live URL**

## What Happens Next:

### After Site Creation:
- âœ… **Site ID** will be visible in site settings
- âœ… **API ID** will be available for GitHub Actions
- âœ… **Live URL** will be generated automatically
- âœ… **Deploy logs** will show build progress

### Your Site Will Have:
- **Folder management features** ready to go
- **Cloudinary chunked upload** for large files
- **Responsive design** for all devices
- **Automatic HTTPS** and CDN

## ðŸŽ¯ Ready to Deploy?

**Choose either method above** - both will get your folder management system live! The Git integration method is best for automatic deployments from GitHub.

Once you create the site, come back and we can:
1. Set up automated GitHub deployments
2. Configure environment variables if needed
3. Add custom domain if desired

**Go create that Netlify site now!** Your folder management features are waiting to go live! ðŸš€
