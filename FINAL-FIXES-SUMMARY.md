# Media File Manager - Final Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

    docker:
      web: Dockerfile
  run:
    web: node server.js
  ```

### 2. Xano API Key Handling
- **Problem**: The application was crashing when the `XANO_API_KEY` environment variable was not set
- **Solution**: Added graceful error handling in the server.js file:
  - Check if `XANO_API_KEY` is set before making API requests
  - Return empty arrays or mock data when the key is missing
  - Log warnings instead of throwing unhandled exceptions

### 3. TypeScript JSX Compilation Errors
- **Problem**: The PreviewService.ts file contained JSX syntax but was not being treated as a JSX file
- **Solution**: 
  - Renamed `PreviewService.ts` to `PreviewService.tsx`
  - Updated the import statement in `App.tsx` to use the correct file extension
  - Ensured TypeScript configuration properly supports JSX compilation

## Testing Results

After implementing these fixes and redeploying:
1. The application now builds successfully without TypeScript errors
4. The API endpoints are functional

## How to Verify the Fix

3. Test the document preview functionality by uploading a PDF or Office document

## Additional Notes

- The fixes have been pushed to the main branch and deployed
- The application should now be stable and handle missing environment variables gracefully
- Document previews should work correctly for all supported file types using the new PreviewService
