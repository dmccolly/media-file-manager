Fix file editor category dropdown to use new category system

Updates FileDetailsModal category options from old system (Images, Files, product) to new system (Image/Graphics, Video, Audio, Documents, Other). 

This ensures consistency across upload form, folder tree, and file editor modal.

The category mapping is:
- image → Image/Graphics
- video → Video  
- audio → Audio
- document → Documents
- other → Other
